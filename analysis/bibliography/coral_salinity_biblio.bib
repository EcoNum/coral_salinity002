abstract = {Here we provide a broad overview of the Great Amazon Reef System (GARS) based on the first-ever video surveys of the region. This footage supports four major hypotheses: 1) the GARS area may be six times larger than previously suggested (up to 56,000 km2); 2) the GARS may extend deeper than previously suggested (up to 220 m); 3) the GARS is composed of a greater complexity and diversity of habitats than previously recognized (e.g. reef platforms, reef walls, rhodolith beds, and sponge bottoms); and 4) the GARS represents useful system to test whether a deep corridor connects the Caribbean Sea to the Southwest Atlantic Ocean. We also call attention to the urgent need to adopt precautionary conservation measures to protect the region in the face of increasing threats from extractive oil and gas practices. With less than 5{\%} of the potential area of the GARS surveyed so far, more research will be required to inform a systematic conservation planning approach and determine how best to establish a network of marine protected areas. Such planning will be required to reconcile extractive activities with effective biodiversity conservation in the GARS.},

abstract = {Coral reefs, considered the rainforests of the seas, are home to a diverse number of marine species. These reefs are tightly woven ecosystems with complex linkages, which, if disturbed, result in an unpleasant chain of events. Furthermore, these reefs are the main source of animal protein for more than a billion people. Aside from supplying food, they stabilize shorelines and protect the land from rising seas and storm damage. Also, they provide sources of medicines used for bone grafts and treatment for certain viruses. However, these reefs are in danger of being permanently damaged as a result of natural and man-made forces. In response to this threat, most marine scientists have suggested that local communities be involved in the implementation and management of programs, with the aim of achieving sustainable reef maintenance. In addition, international agencies have taken the initiative to finance such programs to ensure their continuity. Overall, the management and development of coastal ecosystems depend on how they are managed and not on how they are being exploited. Resources must be rebuilt and their protection ensured for future generations.},

abstract = {During experimental light-dark cycles, O₂ in the tissue of the colonial scleractinian corals Favia sp. and Acropora sp. reached {\textgreater}250{\%} of air saturation after a few minutes in light. Immediately after darkening, O₂ was depleted rapidly, and within 5 min the O₂ concentration at the tissue surface reached {\textless}2{\%} of air saturation. The pH of the tissue changed within 10 min from about 8.5 in the light to 7.3 in the dark. Oxygen and pH profiles revealed a diffusive boundary layer of flow-dependent thickness, which limited coral respiration in the dark. The light field at the tissue surface (measured as scalar irradiance, E₀) differed strongly with respect to light intensity and spectral composition from the incident collimated light (measured as downwelling irradiance, Ed). Scalar irradiance reached up to 180{\%} of Ed at the coral tissue surface for wavelengths subject to less absorption by the coral tissue (600 to 650 nm and {\textgreater}680 nm). The scalar irradiance spectra exhibited bands of chlorophyll a (chl a) (675 nm), chl c (630 to 640 nm) and peridinin (540 nm) absorption and a broad absorption band due to chlorophylls and carotenoids between 400 and 550 nm. The shape of both action spectra and photosynthesis vs irradiance (P vs I) curves depended on the choice of the light intensity parameter. Calculations of initial slopes and onset of light saturation, Ik, showed that P vs E₀ curves exhibit a lower initial slope and a higher Ik than corresponding P vs Ed curves. Coral respiration in light was calculated as the difference between the measured gross and net photosynthesis, and was found to be {\textgreater} 6 times higher at a saturating irradiance of 350 $\mu$Ein m⁻² s⁻¹ than the dark respiration measured under identical hydrodynamic conditions (flow rate of 5 to 6 cm s⁻¹).},

This chapter reviews the life history of reef-building corals and the symbiotic relationships between corals and their algal symbionts and discusses possible collaborative defense systems against environmental stresses as well as mechanisms of adaptation to environmental changes in coral--zooxanthella symbiotic systems. Most corals associate with one main type of symbiont, although minor or cryptic symbiont types are often detected within a colony. The association between the coral host and algal symbiont appears to be stable, and the original symbiont often returns when corals recover from bleaching. Some corals, such as the massive Porites, exhibit high fidelity to certain types of algal symbionts and still have high stress tolerance as well as long life spans suggesting the possibility that stem cells and algal symbiont cells in such long-lived colonies accumulate mutations; in turn, if cells with a higher fitness for a new environment proliferate within a colony, the colony may be able to adapt to the new environment.},

abstract = {Modern coral reefs had their origins in the Triassic Period, and over the past 65 million years, have expanded and contracted due to a variety of extrinsic factors such as sea level and climatic changes. As humans evolved, so did a new era for coral reefs: that of exposure to anthropogenic stressors on top of the already persistent natural events such as hurricanes/typhoons, volcanic eruptions and Acanthaster plancii outbreaks. Early studies of corals and coral reefs focused on taxonomy, ecology and physiology. The establishment of reef-based marine laboratories and technological advances in SCUBA enabled a rapid expansion of in situ studies and the ability to compare reef processes and changes over both space and time. The documented declines in the state of coral reefs worldwide have shifted the focus of many research programs from basic to applied and management-directed research. Expanded studies of reproductive processes, animal-algal symbioses, molecular genetics, ecotoxicology, connectivity, ecological modelling, calcification, cellular biology and biochemistry have allowed researchers to better understand how coral reefs function and how best to respond to a variety of stressors. Coral reef research has necessarily become multidisciplinary in nature, embracing the social and economic as well as the biophysical sciences. In the face of increasing effects of stressors tied to local activities such as poor land-use practices, and mounting concerns tied to global climate change, the bridging of science to policy development, management and conservation is critical if there is to be a legacy of vital reefs left for future generations to enjoy.},

@book{Barange2010,
abstract = {The ocean is a vital component of the metabolism of the Earth and plays a key role in global change. In fact, the oceans cover so much of the Earth's surface that our planet has been described as the Water Planet, and it could be argued that its most extensive ecosystems are marine. Marine ecosystems are inextricably involved in the physical, chemical, biological and societal processes of global change. It is imposs ible to describe and understand the Earth system without understanding the ocean, the special characteristics of the environment that it provides for life, the changes that it is undergoing and the manner in which these changes interact with the total Earth System. Understanding the functioning of marine ecosystems and how they respond to global change is also essential in order to effectively manage global marine living resources, such as fi sheries. The upper trophic levels of marine ecosystems—fi sh, whales, seals and sea- birds—are all prominent in the public eye. Fish, in particular, provide the living marine resources which have sustained human communities over centuries, but which are now increasingly under threat. However, the food webs sustaining these larger vis- ible components of marine ecosystems, composed of small microscopic organisms like plankton, are less well known. The diversity and interactions of plankton are complex. How they will be affected by changes in ocean physics, mixing, currents and circulation resulting from global change is the major challenge that the GLOBEC project is addressing. Similarly, human exploitation of higher trophic levels through fi shing has a major impact on marine ecosystems, which may, in turn, affect the Earth System through changes in ecosystem structure and function. The GLOBEC project is an international response to the need to understand how global change will affect the abundance, diversity and productivity of marine populations, from zooplankton to fi sh, that comprise a major component of oceanic ecosystems. GLOBEC's goal is to advance our understanding of the structure and functioning of such ecosystems, their major subsystems, and responses to physical forcing so that a capability can be developed to forecast the response of marine ecosystems to global change. This volume in the IGBP Science Series, “Marine Ecosystems and Global Change”, gives topical examples of the scientifi c problems that GLOBEC is tackling, the inno- vative approaches adopted, and some selected scientifi c achievements. It has been written at a time when GLOBEC is in the mid-phase of its implementation. The ultimate achievements of GLOBEC research will be presented in a fi nal synthesis at the end of the project},

@article{Cesar2003,
abstract = {Coral reefs are an incredibly valuable ecosystem. Not only are they very important for nature, but they represent a very high value for humankind, supporting millions of people whose lives depend on these natural resources for a source of food and income. Estimates in this report show that coral reefs provide each year nearly US 30 billion in net benefits in goods and services to world economies, including, tourism, fisheries and coastal protection (Table 1). Yet coral reefs are under heavy pressure. Already, 27{\%} is permanently lost and with current trends, a further 30{\%} is at risk of being lost in the coming thirty years. With such devastating levels of destruction, the social and economic implications for the millions of people who depend on coral reefs are of great concern. Over 39{\%} of the world population now live within 100 kilometres of the coast and many people in these areas depend on reefs. Reefs protect coastlines and reef fish provide a source of nutrition and income. Poverty increases and food security decreases as fish stocks are depleted. This drives fishers further toward the use of destructive methods to catch what little there is left. Key causes of coral reef decline have been the over-development of the coastal area and the over-use of coral reef resources. Migration to coastal areas has created a surge in land development leading to clearance of important coastal ecosystems such as mangroves and seagrass beds. Unregulated coastal construction, such as hotels, factories and desalination plants, has increased sedimentation in the coastal waters and is destroying reefs worldwide as light levels in the water column are reduced and reefs are smothered. Untreated sewage and chemical agriculture run-off (e.g. pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers) have caused nutrient loading into coral reef waters, leading to algal blooms and eutrophication. Overfishing and destructive fishing practices have decimated coral reef fish populations and their habitats. In addition, increases in sea surface temperatures associated with global climate change are causing ever more frequent bleaching events. Countries with coral reefs attract millions of SCUBA divers every year, yielding significant economic benefits to the host country. Globally, tourism is estimated to provide US 9.6 billion in annual net benefits and a multiple of this amount in tourism spending (Table 1). These revenue streams in coral reef areas are being threatened by the deterioration of coral reefs. Damage to the reefs has often been caused by the increase in tourism itself, through direct damage by careless tourists and through the unregulated construction and the irresponsible operation of tourist related facilities. Mass tourism poses a threat to reefs and to the income that coral reefs provide to the local population. Sustainable tourism, on the other hand, is a source of income to people in reef areas. It even forms an alternative to destructive fishing practices. Reef fisheries provide nutrition and necessary necessary incomes to millions of people in developing countries. Potential reef fishing benefits are estimated at US 5.7 billion annually. However, increases in fishing effort, driven by rising populations and more effective fishing technology, have led to overfishing, such that the obtained economic value of coral reef fisheries is now close to zero in many developing countries. With fewer fish on the reefs many fishermen have resorted to more efficient yet highly damaging methods, such as bomb and cyanide fishing. Because enforcement of these illegal operations is difficult, the financial incentive to fishers in the short run is high. However, the ecological impact causes a net loss to society. For instance, in areas of Indonesia with high potential value of tourism and coastal protection, the socio-economic costs have been estimated to be four times higher than the total net private benefits from blast fishing. The cost of inaction on blast fishing has been estimated at US 3.8 billion in Indonesia over the last 25 years. These figures would have justified enforcement expenditures of around US 400 million annually. Land-based pollution is another major threat to coral reefs as untreated sewage from urban areas and runoff from chemicals used in agriculture cause sedimentation and mass algal growth. Currently 22{\%} of the worlds coral reefs are under medium to high risk from these land-based sources of pollution. As a result, investment to decrease the flow of sediments and excess nutrients into coastal waters is often justified despite high upfront costs. For example, a proposed wastewater treatment plant in the Florida Keys requires around US 60-70 million in investment costs and around US 4 million annually in operation and mainetance costs. However, in the long-term, the benefits to the local population are much higher, estimated at around US 700 million in Net Present Value (NPV) terms. Additional side benefits such as reduction in water-borne diseases provide further arguments in favour of these investments. To be cost-effective, river basin management should be linked with coastal zone management. This is the essence of the H2O Partnership (from Hilltop to Ocean) launched at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, August 2002. Global climate change and related coral bleaching pose a final set of threats to coral reefs. In 1998, 75{\%} of reefs worldwide were affected by bleaching and 16{\%} suffered mortality. Recent studies predict that bleaching could become an annual event within the next 25 to 50 years. The study here calculates the net present value of future losses over the next 50 years at a 3{\%} discount rate. The losses in the case of the severe coral bleaching scenario with mass coral mortality are estimated around US 83 billion. For the moderate scenario, where bleaching leads to less mortality, costs are estimated at around US 21 billion. Other associated impacts of global climate change also have adverse effects on coral reefs, such as increased frequencies of storms and hurricanes. A recent study estimates that climate change will cause losses of US 109.9 million in the Caribbean due to increased sea-surface temperatures, sea-level rise and loss of species, among others. This is equal to 13.8{\%} of the total GDP in the region. Reduction of other stressors to reefs such as those mentioned above, in combination with climate change adaptation measures, could help to decrease the impacts of climate change and coral bleaching on reefs. Without even attempting to measure their intrinsic value, it is clear that coral reefs contribute enormously to food, income and various other quantifiable benefits, if properly managed. Net potential benefits are estimated at US 30 billion per year. With current trends of reef degradation, revenues will decrease, in some cases by as much as 75{\%} with increasing costs. This will imperil the lives of millions of people who rely on reefs for food and income, especially in developing countries. Good reef management is costly, but the losses will be much higher if we fail to take action now. The choice is ours.},

abstract = {The ability of endosymbioses between anthozoans and dinoflagellate algae (zooxanthellae) to retain excretory nitrogen and take up ammonium from seawater has been well documented. However, the quantitative importance of these processes to the nitrogen budget of such symbioses is poorly understood. When starved symbiotic Anemonia viridis were incubated in a flow-through system in seawater supplemented with 20 mu M ammonium for 91 d under a light regime of 12 h light at 150 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) and 12 h darkness, they showed a mean net growth of 0.197{\%} of their initial weight per day. Control anemones in unsupplemented seawater with an ammonium concentration of {\textless}1 mu M lost weight by a mean of 0.263{\%} of their initial weight per day. Attempts to construct a nitrogen budget showed that, over a 14 d period, similar or equal to 40{\%} of the ammonium taken up could be accounted for by growth of zooxanthellae. It was assumed that the remainder was translocated from zooxanthellae to host. However, since the budget does not balance, only 60{\%} of the growth of host tissue was accounted for by this translocation. The value for host excretory nitrogen which was recycled to the symbionts equalled that taken in by ammonium uptake from the supplemented seawater, indicating the importance of nitrogen retention to the symbiotic association.},

abstract = {Hurricanes occur in belts 7{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}} to 25{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}} north and south of the equator. Reefs growing in these belts suffer periodic damage from hurricane-generated waves and storm surge. Corals down to 20m depth may be broken and removed, branching colonies being much more susceptible to breakage than upright massive forms. Sand cays may be washed away and former storm ridges may migrate to leeward across reef flats to link with islands. Reef crest and reef front coral debris accumulate as talus at the foot of the fore-reef slope, on submarine terraces and grooves, on the intertidal reef flat as storm ridges of shingle or boulders and isolated blocks of reef framework, as accreting beach ridges of leeward migrating shingle, as lobes and wedges of debris in back-reef lagoons, as drapes of carbonate sand and mud in deep off-reef locations in the fore-reef and lagoonal areas. In addition to the coarse debris deposited, other features may aid the recognition of former hurricane events, including the assemblage of reef biota, its species composition and the structure of the skeletons; graded internal sediments in framework cavities; characteristic sequences of encrusting organisms; characteristic shapes of reef flat microatoll corals; and submarine cement crusts over truncated reef surfaces. The abundance of reef flat storm deposits whose ages cluster around 3000--4000 y BP in certain parts of the world most likely relate to a slight fall in relative sea level rather than an increase in storminess during that period. A higher frequency of storms need not result in more reef flat storm deposits. The violence of the storm relative to normal fair-weather conditions influences the extent of damage; the length of time since the previous major storm influences the amount of coral debris created; the length of time after the hurricane, and before a subsequent storm influences the degree of stabilization of reef-top storm deposits and hence their chances of preservation.},

abstract = {Storm floods on the night of December 31, 1987 reduced salinity to 15{\{}$\backslash$texttenthousand{\}} in the surface waters of Kaneohe Bay, resulting in massive mortality of coral reef organisms in shallow water. A spectacular phytoplankton bloom occurred in the following weeks. Phytoplankton growth was stimulated by high concentrations of plant nutrients derived partially from dissolved material transported into the bay by flood runoff and partially by decomposition of marine organisms killed by the flood. Within two weeks of the storm, chlorophyll a concentrations reached 40 mg m-3, one of the highest values ever reported. The extremely rapid growth rate of phytoplankton depleted dissolved plant nutrients, leading to a dramatic decline or ``crash'' of the phytoplankton population. Water quality parameters returned to values approaching the long-term average within 2 to 3 months. Corals, echinoderms, crustaceans and other creatures suffered extremely high rates of mortality in shallow water. Virtually all coral was killed to depths of 1--2m in the western and southern portions of the bay. Elimination of coral species intolerant to lowered salinity during these rare flood events leads to dominance by the coral Porites compressa. After a reef kill, this species can eventually regenerate new colonies from undifferentiated tissues within the ``dead'' perforate skeleton. Catastrophic flood disturbances in Kaneohe Bay are infrequent, probably occurring once every 20 to 50 years, but play an important role in determination of coral community structure. The last major fresh water reef kill occurred in 1965 when sewage was being discharged into Kaneohe Bay. Coral communities did not recover until after sewage abatement in 1979. Comparison between recovery rate after the two flood events suggests that coral reefs can recover quickly from natural disturbances, but not under polluted conditions.},
